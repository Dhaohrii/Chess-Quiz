        <h1>About Chess</h1>
        <h5>Chess is a timeless and captivating game that has enthralled people for centuries. In this section, we delve into the essence of chess, from its fundamental rules to its fascinating history.</h5>
            <h4>The Basics of Chess :</h4>
                <h6>Chess is played on a square board divided into 64 squares of alternating colors. Two players, each with 16 pieces, face off in a strategic battle. The game revolves around the movement and interaction of six types of pieces: King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, and Pawn. Each piece has its unique moves and powers, making chess a game of infinite possibilities.</h6>

                <h3>Chess Pieces and rules :</h3>
                    <h6>Understanding the roles and rules of each chess piece is essential. The King ♚ is your most precious piece, and its safety is paramount. The Queen ♛ is a formidable force, capable of moving in any direction. Rooks ♜ and Bishops ♝ control the board with their unique patterns, while Knights ♞ have their distinctive L-shaped jumps. Pawns ♟, though limited in their initial moves, can transform into powerful pieces upon reaching the opponent's back rank. The goal? To checkmate your opponent's King, putting it in a position where it cannot escape capture.</h6>
            <h4>A Historical Perspective :</h4>
                <h6>Chess has a rich and storied history that spans over a thousand years.

Over time, chess spread across the world, evolving into the modern game we know today. It became a symbol of intellectual prowess, a beloved pastime, and even a subject of artistic and literary exploration. The history of chess is a journey through the cultures and minds that have shaped this timeless pursuit.</h6>

                        <b>Blitz Chess:</b> Blitz chess is the fastest-paced, with each player having just 3-5 minutes for the entire game, often with a 2-3 second increment per move.
                        <b>Classic Chess:</b> Classic chess is the most traditional format, where players usually have over an hour for each game.</h6>
                <h3>Elo Rating System :</h3>
                    <h6>The Elo rating system is used to assess the relative skill levels of chess players. It assigns a numerical rating to each player based on their performance in rated games. Players gain or lose Elo points based on their results against opponents, helping to gauge their strength accurately.</h6>
